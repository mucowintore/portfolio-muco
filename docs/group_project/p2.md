# Project Phase 2: Divergent Design
13 November 2024

## Broad Application Goals 
LinguaLink is a platform targeted towards communities with endangered languages that empowers them to lead preservation efforts of their language through crowdsourcing tools in a collaborative dictionary. LinguaLink also provides learning features to foster intergenerational transmission of the language through flashcards and quizzes that highlight different aspects of a culture's heritage. Beyond existing solutions in the problem domain, LinguaLink provides one centralized location for communities to document their endangered language and provides tooling for members of these communities to help teach future generations.

## Scrapbook of Comparables
![Quizlet Snippet](./p2_quizlet.png)
This snippet comes from quizlet.com which is a website that provides personalized quizzes and practice tests. This could be useful to our design brainstorming because we would want to include some similar functionalities that are part of their study tools. Their use of icons and spacing make it an easy website to navigate which are things we can take into account when designing our website. 

![Webster Snippet](./p2_webster.png)
This is a screenshot from Merriam-webster’s word of the day page. This could be useful to our design brainstorming because we could use a similar idea for having a word of the day feature and also the spacing of the word, the audio and the definition could inform us of a useful way to implement this system. 

![Babble Snippet](./p2_babbel.png)
Babbel shows different ways to approach learning exercises, as well as suggesting a Live classes feature. This language learning app provides an adjacent purpose to our project making it ripe for inspiration.

![Forvo Snippet](./p2_forvo.png)
This is the homepage of Forvo.com. We could draw inspiration from the way Forvo allows users to contribute multiple pronunciations for words, especially given that we want to enable communities to contribute word pronunciations. 

![Dictionary List View Snippet](./p2_takelma.png)
This is a dictionary list page from Cow Creek Education for their online Takelma language dictionary. This could be useful inspiration for the layout of our various dictionary list pages.

![Expanded Word View Snippet](./p2_dictionary.com.png)
This is an expanded view on a word in Dictionary.com. This could be useful inspiration for the general layout of the expanded word views in our app.

## Outlining Your App
### Dictionary-ing
- Purpose: To document words in the language 
- Operational Principle: After adding a word entry in the dictionary, users will be able to find relevant information about that word in one location.
### Flashcarding
- Purpose: To help facilitate the learning process of words for users
- Operational Principle: After getting a flashcard, a user will see a defining representation of a word on one side of the flashcard and the word itself on the other side.
### Quizzing
- Purpose: Purpose: To learn about various aspects of the language and culture
- Operational Principle: After creating a quiz, users can take the quiz and select from multiple answer options, after which the website will inform them if they selected the correct one.
### Upvoting
- Purpose: Rank community contributions based on user approval
- Operational Principle: After an item gets upvoted, its associated number of upvotes increases by 1. This number is visible to all users.
### Grouping

## Storyboard and Sketches
Storyboard one focuses on a user trying to learn some words in a language that the person’s grandparents speak but they are not very familiar with the language. 

We found clicking through multiple tabs to add a word to be a minor point of friction

Storyboard two focuses on a user trying to add vocab from their native language to the online dictionary to help other users learn.
