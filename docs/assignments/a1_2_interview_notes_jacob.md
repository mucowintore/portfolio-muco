# A1 Interview Notes (Jacob)

### How do you feel about the current place Burundian culture and language have in today’s Burundian society?

- He points out that culture is dynamic and constantly changing. He also says that it is important for Burundians to have context and awareness of why things are evolving the way they are.

- He provides an example of how wedding ceremonies have evolved in Burundian society and how what used to be a multi-day ceremony (the wedding ceremony itself, a visit from the parents the following day, etc) is now often simulated the same day, sometimes losing meaning in the process.

- He mentions that there are usually understandable reasons behind such changes, such as the expensive nature of ceremonies taking place over several days. However, he thinks it is also due to a lack of awareness of the cultural meaning of those traditions in the younger generations and that educating the young about culture is essential.

- He mentions that culture is an integral part of a community, and can lead to cohesion and prosperity, and that a people without culture is doomed to disappear. 

- He points out a need to balance the need to preserve and transmit culture with the need to adapt to the environment and the demands of a changing world. 


### Would you say Burundian language and culture are endangered or not?

- Yes and no. Culture is dynamic and therefore has to evolve with neighboring cultures and the world at large. That’s inevitable

- However, because of this trend towards globalization, there is a need to intensify efforts to preserve Burundian culture and values taught through traditional stories, songs, as well as traditional institutions. He delves into an example of such traditional institutions.



### You have focused quite extensively on the importance of culture and why it should be preserved. Could you talk a bit more about the language as well? What would you say about the state of the Kirundi language at the moment, in young and older generations, as well as the general trend?

- Language is particularly important because culture is transmitted through language. He mentions that the fact that Kirundi is spoken nationwide in Burundi is an asset Burundians should leverage as it makes it easier to unify efforts to teach and promote Burundian culture and language nationwide and to Burundians abroad.

- Parents should take time to teach their kids Kirundi. He notes the importance of teaching French and English to children given their importance in today’s world, but parents should invest just as much time in teaching their children their native language.

- If you don’t know the language, you can’t learn the culture properly. He provides an example of speeches in ceremonies which are full of cultural references that make them difficult to understand without familiarity with the language.

- He gives the example of Burundian children growing up in the diaspora and how many of them have little to no proficiency in their native language.

- He emphasizes that Burundian culture is fundamentally an oral tradition and that his generation learned the culture and the language mainly through stories, poetry, songs, and proverbs told by parents and relatives. He points out that parents rarely do the same with today’s young generation.


### You have mentioned something that I would like to explore further about Burundian culture having been primarily transmitted through oral tradition from one generation to the next. Could you talk a bit more about that, in the context of culture and language preservation?

- There needs to be other means of transmitting and recording that knowledge, because otherwise that knowledge will disappear. He suggests recording in writing, taking photographs, because 50 years from now, things will have changed drastically.
He mentions existing efforts in that direction, such as TV and radio shows where elders would be invited to share their experiences and how things were in the past.
- **Would you say this intergenerational transmission of culture and language is being done properly at the moment to the young generation?**
- Language preservation is something that requires a lot of resources. We are in an era where we are instilling Western culture in the youth. While foreign languages like French and English are valued and rightly so in the context of globalization, it seems that Kirundi is not given enough importance and this should change.
- He mentions folk music as an example. He laments the fact that there are practically no resources available to young and talented folk musicians who sing in Kirundi and that many give up the profession because they can’t make a living through their art and they can’t find any funding to pursue their art.
- He mentions a positive initiative to use Kirundi in meetings in government and other public functions. And while he acknowledges there can be limitations, for example in scientific settings where the language can lack the required terminology, he points it out as an encouraging example of Burundians giving their language the importance it deserves and not relegating it to a second-class language.
- He mentions that children who grow up in the city tend to have less exposure to Kirundi than children in the countryside. They end up being more exposed to French, which is used in school for all subjects, and through the internet and TV. They end up considering Kirundi as being less useful than a language such as French, which is taught in school for all subjects. Therefore, it is important to provide those kids with opportunities and a space to learn their native language. He identifies parents as having a key role to play to provide their children with more opportunities to speak Kirundi.

### You mentioned some of the constraints that exist when it comes to teaching Kirundi to the young generation as well as the lack of funds and resources to that effect. I am curious to hear what you think is or could be the relationship between new technologies, and social media in particular, and efforts to preserve and promote Burundian language and culture. 

- He mentions that new technologies and social media can provide a space to document and share Burundian culture.

- He mentions that such platforms could serve as a repository that would include videos where experts and elders could share knowledge on culture and history with the young generation, where people could publish and get access to books on various subjects about Burundian culture, where artists can share their work.

- He emphasizes that there are some resources that exist such as books and TV shows, but that social media can make that content particularly appealing and accessible to the younger generation

- He also draws attention to the importance such platforms would have, given that most of Burundian culture has traditionally been transmitted through oral tradition. Such a platform would provide a more reliable form of preservation of that cultural heritage.

### Are there any social media platform you regularly use?
- The interviewee mentions that he uses WhatsApp and YouTube. He emphasizes that YouTube in particular is a platform that he enjoys using, with a very large catalog of videos on so many topics.


### Are there any examples of social media being used to promote Burundian cultural heritage in the social media platforms you use in your daily life?

- He mentions that when you type Burundi on YouTube, there is a lot of content related to Burundian culture, such as Burundian folk music of various genres. He marvels at the wealth and variety of content related to Burundi on the platform.

- He mentions how he can find songs from some of his favorite Burundian artists from the 70s, as well as folk artists playing traditional instruments

- He notes that while there have been attempts in the past to document various aspects of Burundian culture, those resources are usually stored as research material in university libraries and not accessible to the public. He mentions that if such material was made available through social media, it would reach so many more people.
- He also points out that most of the material on Burundian culture covered in school is taught in a way that doesn’t make it approachable or appealing to the young generation. He suggests that teaching that material in a format that is more engaging and more accessible, through videos and images for example, would be much more effective.

###  Are there limitations of social media platforms like YouTube with regard to promoting Burundian culture?

- He notes that given how much content there is on YouTube, it can be challenging to discover content related to Burundian culture in the midst of all the content available on the platform.

- He mentions that there needs to be a way to ensure that content related to history and traditional practices and customs is checked for historical accuracy and that on the existing platforms, anyone can share anything about any given topic, and this can easily lead to misinformation.
