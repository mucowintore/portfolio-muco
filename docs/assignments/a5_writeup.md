# A5 Write-up

## Figma Wireframes
- [Figma wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/fvI8x4PvyDArLFJy2CS6HI/6.1040-Akaranga-Wireframes?node-id=0-1&t=kvPzowfLky1Uc0bp-1)

## Heuristic evaluation and writeup
### Usability criteria
- Discoverability: I noticed that while I feel the interface in my wireframes is generally intuitive, it would be helpful to have instructions in various sections of the app. For example, in the Create Post flow, having just under the Create Post title a short summary of what to do so the user knows how to navigate the interface the very first time
<br>
- Pleasantness: In order to promote pleasantness, I think I should add color and a nice font to my design, without overwhelming the user. A sparse but effective use of color and font to enhance the aesthetics of my app would greatly improve the pleasantness of my wireframes
<br>
### Physical heuristics
- Gestalt principles: The posts are laid out in a uniform fashion, even for posts of different types such as video, audio and text posts, leading to a consistent interface that gives at a glance a good idea of what functionalities are available to the user

- Accelerators: My wireframes do not currently offer accerelators, something I might consider adding in the final iteration in order to make the interface more convenient

### Linguistic level
- Speak a user's language: One thing I didn't consider is that given that the initial user audience I built the app for speaks Kirundi, a tonal language, and that the language uses diacritic symbols in order to convey tone, I will have to make sure I use a font that supports diacritic symbols in order to ensure that the text on the platform is properly rendered.

- Consistency: I feel the wireframes do implement consistency especially across post types, ensuring that posts that have text, audio, or video content have the same general layout
