# A5 Write-up

## Figma Wireframes
- [Figma wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/fvI8x4PvyDArLFJy2CS6HI/6.1040-Akaranga-Wireframes?node-id=0-1&t=kvPzowfLky1Uc0bp-1)

## Heuristic evaluation and writeup
### Usability criteria
- Discoverability: I noticed that while I feel the interface in my wireframes is generally intuitive, it would be helpful to have instructions in some places. For example, in the Create Post flow, having just under the Create Post title a short summary of what to do so the user knows how to navigate the interface the very first time
<br>
- Safety: Another concern that came to mind when revisiting my wireframes is the use of dialog boxes to confirm certain actions such as creation and deletion of posts
<br>
### Physical heuristics
- Gestalt principles: The posts are laid out in a uniform fashion, even for posts of different types such as video, audio and text posts, leading to a consistent interface

- Accelerators: My wireframes do not currently offer accerelators, something I might consider adding in the final iteration in order to make the interface more convenient

### Linguistic level
- Speak a user's language: I didn't consider internationalization during the concept of the wireframes. This would be useful especially since features like the translating concept deals with various languages

- Consistency: I feel the wireframes do implement consistency especially across post types
