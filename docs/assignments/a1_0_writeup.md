# A1 Write-up


## Theme

I would like to explore how social media can be used to help preserve and promote endangered languages and cultures.

My goal is to build an app that leverages key social media features such as content creation, aggregation, sharing, and rich user interaction to provide communities with a space where they can connect, document, and learn about their cultural heritage and language.


## Interview plan

To explore the theme above, I have chosen to interview two individuals from Burundi, a small country in Central Africa home to 12 million people. The national language of Burundi is Kirundi. It is the main language spoken nationwide. French and English are also official languages and French is the language of instruction in schools as well as the language used in administration and business.

I have chosen to focus on Burundi for this assignment because Burundi is my home country and this provides me with familiarity and access to the Burundian community, which I think will be helpful as I explore my theme. However, I think the theme can apply to any culture where a need for preservation and promotion exists.


### Who I chose to interview
I have chosen to interview two Kirundi speakers:
A young woman in her mid-twenties who, for anonymity, I will call Grace. Grace was born and raised in the capital city. She went to university and is currently working as an operations supervisor in an energy and oil company.  She is an avid social media user, using several social media platforms regularly. 

A man in his mid-sixties who I will call Jacob. Jacob, like most Burundians of his generation, grew up in the countryside. He moved to the capital city to attend university and has lived there since then. He is a medical doctor. He has some experience with social media platforms and uses just one social media platform.



### Why I wish to interview them

Both Grace and Jacob are Kirundi speakers and grew up in Burundi, but they have very different backgrounds, which I believe will enable me to capture a variety of perspectives as I explore my theme. 

I have chosen Grace and Jacob for this assignment for the following reasons:
- Jacob grew up in the countryside in the fifties and as a result, has been thoroughly immersed in Burundian culture growing up. In contrast, Grace grew up in the capital city and attended some of the best schools in the city. She has been much more exposed to Western culture, be it through school, traditional media such as TV, or the internet than she has been to her own culture. As a result, Jacob and Grace’s proficiency in the language and knowledge of the culture vary greatly. My hope is to learn whether the subject I am exploring and its relevance or lack thereof are perceived differently across generations and backgrounds.
- Being of different generations, Grace and Jacob have very different experiences with social media. Grace has been an avid user since quite young whereas Jacob was introduced to social media at a much later point in life. I am curious to see how this affects their relationship with social media and its perceived relevance to the subject I am exploring.


### Questions I plan to cover

In order to explore the theme above, I have chosen to cover the following interview questions, grouped around 3 main topics:
- Relevance of the subject
    - How do you feel about the current place Burundian culture and language have in today’s Burundian society?
    - How do you feel about the state of Burundian culture and language 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

- Experience with social media
    - What social media platforms do you use on a regular basis?
    - What do you enjoy about them?
    - What do you use them for?

- Perception of the relationship between social media and culture preservation and promotion
    - We have discussed the state of Burundian culture as well as social media platforms. In your opinion, is there a relationship between social media and culture preservation and promotion?
    - Do social media platforms have a role to play in promoting Burundian culture and language? If so, are there examples of that role you can see from your personal experience with those platforms?
    - What positive or adverse effects of the existing social media platforms can you observe on Burundian culture and language?
    - What are limitations in the role existing social media platforms can play in the promotion and preservation of Burundian cultural heritage?


I plan on conducting interviews in Kirundi to ensure the participants can talk comfortably during the interview. I will ask the participants to record the interviews so that I can take detailed notes afterward, translated to English.

## Interview report

### Interview with Grace

I started by asking Grace how she felt about the state of Burundian culture and language in today’s society. She answered by making a quite telling observation: that even though we were speaking Kirundi in the interview, we kept mixing it up with French and English and that it was reflective of a larger trend among Burundian society because of the extensive exposure to Western culture through school, TV and the Internet. She described her relationship with her language as “a very strong situationship”, a choice of words I found interesting. She elaborated by adding “Kirundi and I don’t get each other, we keep sending each other mixed signals”, and says she’s been trying her best but just when she feels she’s starting to make progress with the language, she hits a wall. She concludes her answer by saying that, nevertheless, she considers her relationship with Kirundi strong because she’s not willing to give up improving her Kirundi despite the challenges.

Grace mentioned that she uses YouTube and Instagram regularly. She enjoys how those platforms expose her to so many things from around the world that she wouldn’t learn about otherwise. She believes social platforms can play a very positive role in promoting language and culture, citing an account on IG that shares archival photographs and knowledge of historical sites of Burundi. She also mentions another account she likes that shares traditional Burundian riddles. However, she also points out that most of the local content creators on those platforms tend to modernize their content to conform to what is prevalent or trending on those platforms in order to garner as many followers as possible, rather than promoting culture or language. She also points out that while some of the content on those platforms enables her to learn more about her culture, they do not really help her improve her proficiency in the language.


### Interview with Jacob

Jacob pointed out that culture is dynamic and ever-changing. He expresses two seemingly opposite but, according to him, equally important realities: that culture needs to adapt to a constantly evolving environment to survive, and that culture is an integral part of a community that needs to be transmitted from one generation to the next for that community to thrive and preserve its identity. He notes that the younger generation lives in a very different environment from the one his generation grew up in, with limited exposure to Kirundi and Burundian culture. He warns that given that Burundian culture has mostly been transmitted through oral tradition, most of the cultural heritage could disappear with the older generation unless more effort to preserve it, document it, and transmit it to the younger generation takes place.

Jacob mentioned that he uses YouTube regularly. He believes platforms like YouTube can be a very powerful way to introduce Burundian culture to a wider audience. He mentions that when you type Burundi on YouTube, there is a wealth of material on Burundian culture. He points out that using such platforms would be a far more effective and engaging way to reach the younger generation, using videos and photographs rather than the more traditional, text-centered approach in school. He also notes there are limitations with existing social media platforms, notably the fact that anyone can post about anything and that in the context of culture-related content, this can lead to inaccuracy and misinformation. He recommends that there be a mechanism to fact-check and moderate such content. He also points out that it can be difficult to discover content on Burundian culture amid YouTube’s immense catalogue, unless one is specifically looking for such content.

## Design opportunities

- **Digital archive platform for cultural heritage documentation**
    - This would enable communities with cultures based on oral tradition to document and preserve their cultural heritage
    - Community members could contribute video content on a variety of culture-related topics, such as history, art, music, poetry, customs, and other cultural artifacts
    - It would include a mix of collaborative and automated mechanisms around content moderation and fact checking that ensure that the content presented on the platform is historically and culturally accurate
    - It would include a discovery and recommendation feature that enables community members to easily learn new facts about their culture
    - Content could be grouped into categories, enabling the users to explore particular topics of interest


- **Collaborative dictionary**
    - This would enable communities to harness the power of crowdsourcing to document their language
    - Community members could contribute word definitions, pronunciation, usage examples, and visual aids
    - Community members could use this dictionary to look up and learn new words (which, while taken for granted in many countries, can be surprisingly hard when there are no comprehensive dictionaries available for your language)
	

- **Interactive language lessons**
    - This would enable the community, and the younger generation in particular, to more easily learn their language. This is often a challenge for communities whose languages are not widely spoken around the world to find resources to easily learn their languages, as Grace pointed out in her interview
    - Members could create, share, and access quizzes on vocabulary, grammar and culture trivia
	

- **Collaborative recording, transcription, and translation of cultural texts**
    - This would enable oral tradition communities to put in writing and therefore preserve traditional stories, songs, poetry and other significant cultural artifacts traditionally transmitted orally from one generation to the next
    - This would enable the younger generations to learn and understand those texts
    - This would expand the corpus of recorded, written and translated text available in the language, making it easier to build natural language processing tools (automated translation, text to speech, speech to text, etc).
