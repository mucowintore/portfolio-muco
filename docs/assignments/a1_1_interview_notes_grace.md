# A1 Interview Notes (Grace)

### What is your perspective regarding the current place Burundian culture and language have among Burundians?

- She starts by providing a quite telling observation, highlighting the fact that even as we start this interview, we are not speaking Kirundi exclusively. We are mixing it up extensively with French and English.
- She elaborated, saying that people tend to conform to what they are exposed to. She provided the example of music you listen to, books you read, the language in which you listen to the news, etc, all those things influence how you express yourself, and as a result, you find yourself using the expressions and words you hear or read about the most, and this tends to result in using a lot of French and English to express yourself, even when speaking in Kirundi
- She noted that the fact that children are taught school subjects in languages other than their own (French and English) has its advantages, enabling children to benefit from opportunities abroad and to be competitive on an international level
However, she points out that the issue is that kids spend all their school time being taught in French, and then come home and watch TV programs in French and English, leading to children growing up not speaking or being exposed to their language enough to speak it well, due to an environment that primarily exposes them to other languages.

### You mentioned how Burundian children are raised in an environment where they are mainly exposed to languages other than their own and that as a result, they grow up not learning to speak their language properly. Are there things you feel are being done to address that issue?

- She says that while the situation could be significantly improved, there are some encouraging initiatives.
- She mentions TV and radio shows that attempt to showcase and teach about Burundian language and culture
- She also mentions accounts on Instagram that highlight Burundian culture and history
- She concludes that while there are encouraging initiatives, we are at a point where Burundians, and especially the young, tend to speak Kirundi that is very mixed with other languages
- She mentions that that’s even the case with content online such as YouTube videos where for example, the host invites guests to discuss about a given topic. They tend to speak in Kirundi but with a heavy reliance on French and English to express themselves
- She mentions that while she feels that there is a desire among other young people to speak their own language better and give it more value, she is worried that there is a risk that the older generation, who are the ones who know the language, will disappear eventually and a lot of what makes the richness of Kirundi and Burundian culture will be lost
- She concludes that while there are some initiatives in that direction, it is not enough and we still need more work in order to get to a place where Kirundi’s place is secure among Burundians. She says that is the only way to ensure that the language survives among other languages that dominate today’s world. She emphasized the fragile nature of the language at the moment.

### You mentioned something that I would like to explore further. You mentioned that there are encouraging initiatives and, among those, you gave the example of accounts on IG that promote Burundian culture. Could you tell me a bit more about that?

- She starts by noting that to learn a language, you need to learn the culture and history. She then provides the example of an account on IG that she follows and that shares archival pictures of various Burundian landmarks and historical sites, along with informative captions that provide historical context about those places.
- She mentions another account on Instagram that shares Kirundi riddles in the style of a traditional game called “Sokwe Niruze” where users are presented a riddle and prompted to solve it.
- She notes that getting exposed to culture in such a way, through a game approach, would make it a lot more engaging.
- She adds that she wished some of the Kirundi texts that are taught in elementary school are very rich and full of valuable vocabulary, proverbs, etc, but they are not very accessible to children who haven’t grown in the countryside because the settings of those texts tend to be in the countryside. Therefore, making that material accessible to children in the city through social media and games that make them more accessible to them would be far more effective in introducing them to Kirundi and Burundian culture and keeping them connected to their culture and language
- She wished there were board games and other modern form of games that introduce Kirundi to the youth
- She concludes that social media is essential to reach the young generation because that’s where they spend a considerable amount of their time and interact with the world
- She notes that the fact that content on social media is not constrained to just one topic makes it a great way to introduce culture and language through various subjects of daily life and various interests people might have

### You’ve given several examples of Burundian culture and language being promoted on Instagram. What would you say are the social media platforms you use the most?

She says she uses Instagram and Youtube the most.

### What would you say you like about Instagram and Youtube? What keeps you coming back to those platforms?

- She pauses a little bit and then mentions that she realizes she uses those platforms mostly to connect with other cultures.
- She then asks the question of why she doesn’t use those platforms to connect with her own culture, what goes on in her own country
- She provides the example of fashion and how she goes on IG to stay updated with fashion trends. She points out that she rarely goes there looking for fashion trends from Burundi and she wonders why that is.
- She then comes back to answering the question about what she likes about those platforms, saying that she loves how much content and variety there is on those platforms, and how you learn things you would probably never learn know about otherwise. She points that social media allows her to learn so many things, life hacks and tips from people all over the world, that make her life easier. It’s also fun, with plenty of fun videos available on those platforms

### You’ve mentioned several things that you like about those platforms and what they enable you to do. Now to come back to the subject of language and culture preservation and promotion, are there limitations or adverse effects those social platforms have with regard to that goal of promoting and preserving language and culture?

- She points that because of the exposure to other more mainstream cultures on those platforms, people tend to try to adapt or modernize elements of Burundian culture in order to get it in line with what is trending or prevalent on those platforms. And she points out that people often do that in the name of being creative, but she disagrees with that, saying that this leads to inauthenticity in many cases.
- She provides an example of people sharing content in Kirundi on social media tend to feel the peer pressure to include French or English when they speak in order to sound educated.
- She also mentions that on the existing social media platforms, people who share content in Kirundi don’t necessarily have culture and language promotion as a goal. Most of the time, they put out content depending on what they think people will want to hear or as a way to gain more followers. Therefore, while they do speak in Kirundi, they don’t necessarily provide content that can improve your command of the language or knowledge of the culture.
- She points out that while there are accounts on Instagram she follows that enrich her knowledge of Burundian culture, she feels those platforms are lacking when it comes to learning the language itself


### We have talked in great detail about the state of Kirundi and Burundian culture in general. I would like now that you tell me about your personal relationship with Kirundi and Burundian culture. How do you feel about your current level of proficiency or familiarity with Kirundi and culture?

- She provides a very surprising and evocative answer, describing her relationship with Kirundi and culture as a “very strong situationship”. She further adds: “Kirundi and I don’t get each other, we keep sending each other mixed signals”. She says that she tries her best to learn and improve her Kirundi, and then when she feels like she’s making progress, she hits a wall. 
- She provides as an example learning tone marking when writing Kirundi and how she has tried to master it to no avail. She mentions that she has found the way it is taught in school very confusing and she has practically given up on trying to master that particular aspect of Kirundi, despite its importance in writing or reading Kirundi properly.
- Nevertheless, she mentions that her relationship with Kirundi is strong because she is not willing to give up improving her Kirundi, despite the challenges she has faced in the past.
