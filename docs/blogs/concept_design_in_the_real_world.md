# Concept Design in the real world

Monday’s TA review session was a great way to go through the concept design process from start to finish, from concept definition to data modeling and implementation, and internalize how all those phases fit together. This got me curious to learn how the concept-based approach to building software is used in practice. As I explored the use of concept design in the real world, I came across really interesting examples.

### Palantir's experiment with Concept Design

The first example I read about was how Palantir integrated concept design into its development process. I came across the experiment in one of Daniel Jackson’s blogs, as well as a paper he co-authored that further details the experiment (both linked below).

Palantir harnessed concept design by surfacing the concepts that underly a wide range of its products, documenting those concepts into a centralized inventory, and making it widely accessible throughout the organization.

One of the benefits of this effort was a better alignment of their products, which reduced design inconsistencies of functionality shared across products that had previously led to user confusion. By adopting a concept-centric approach, that shared functionality could be identified, documented across teams, and implemented in a consistent fashion across products.

One insight I found particularly interesting is how the benefits of concept design extended beyond engineering teams to positively impact people in more client-facing positions. By documenting product functionality in a shared concept repository widely accessible to various departments, people in marketing positions were able to better understand the capabilities of the company’s products and thus better communicate them to clients.


### Concept Design and AI

Another cool example I found about concept design is its potential application to AI, as detailed in a Forbes article summarizing a discussion between Daniel Jackson and John Werner (linked below). I was quite curious to find out how concept design could be applied to AI.

One application of concept design principles to AI that I found quite compelling in the article is with assistive technology. Equipping AI agents with an understanding of software concepts could make them more effective at assisting and answering users’ queries on how to use a particular app and embedding such functionality directly in the app.

### Conclusion

Learning about the use of concept design in the real world has enabled me to look at what we have learned so far in class through a new lens. In particular, this made me realize the power and versatility of a concept-centered approach to building software and gain insights into how we can apply those skills outside the classroom.
